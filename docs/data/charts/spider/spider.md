<p class="description">Spider chart allows to compare multivariate data in a 2D chart.</p>

## Simple Spider Charts

A spider chart, also known as a radar chart or web chart, is a graphical representation that displays multivariate data in a two-dimensional form. It consists of a series of axes radiating from a central point, with each axis representing a different variable. Data points are plotted along each axis, and a polygon is formed by connecting these points. This chart allows for easy comparison and identification of patterns or trends across multiple variables.
